Cab Booking System Description
         A Cab Booking System is a software application designed to help users book rides conveniently and efficiently. It connects passengers with available drivers through a centralized platform. The system can be developed for desktop, web, or mobile, depending on requirements.

Key Features:
             User Module (Passenger):
             Register/login into the system.
            Book a cab by entering pickup and drop-off locations.
             View available cab options (Mini, Sedan, SUV, etc.).
              Track ride status (booked, on the way, completed).
            Cancel booking if needed.
            Payment options (cash, card, wallet).

Driver Module:
             Register/login as a driver.
             Accept or reject ride requests.
             Navigate to passenger pickup and drop-off locations.
             Update ride status (accepted, started, completed).

Admin Module:
            Manage users (passengers and drivers).
            Monitor bookings and ride history.
            Handle complaints, cancellations, and payments.
            Generate reports for analysis (e.g., total rides, revenue).

Workflow:
            The passenger logs in → selects pickup & drop location → searches for available cabs.
            System assigns a nearby driver (or allows the passenger to choose).
            Driver accepts the ride → passenger gets ride details (driver name, vehicle number, ETA).
            After completion, fare is calculated automatically based on distance/time.
            Passenger makes payment and gives feedback.

Technical Aspects:
                  Front-end: C++ (console or GUI), or Web/Mobile interface.
                  Back-end: Database for storing users, drivers, rides, payments (e.g., MySQL/SQLite).

Core Logic:
              Distance & fare calculation algorithms.
              Ride assignment logic (nearest cab allocation).
              Data validation and security for users.

Use Cases:
               Personal transport booking.
              Employee/company travel management.
              Tour and travel agencies.
